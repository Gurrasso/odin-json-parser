# ODIN json parser

A parser and stringifier for json using the odin language.

## Description

This is a simple parser and stringifier for odin. This can be used to write json to a file or to read json from a file. It's still a work in progress but the base functionality is there. There is already a json parser inside of "core:encoding/json".

The code is probably full of bugs and bad code but it works. It also isn't very strict on your json syntax.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* All you need to run this is the odin compiler along with the standard odin packages(core, base, ect)

### Installing

* To download just clone this repo and put it in your project or in your odin shared packages folder

### Executing program

* Lets first take a small look at the error handeling

## Help

It's just odin code, there shouldn't be any major problems other than the code being bad. If you have a problem maybe try checking your odin version and if it's outdated update it.

To check the version run this in your command prompt
```
odin version
```
